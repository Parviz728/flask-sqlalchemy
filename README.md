# flask-sqlalchemy
Hi, everyone/ Welcome to my first train mini project with flask and sqlalchemy. Here i did just few basic operation with flask and sqlalchemy to see how they interact with each other. They are:
1. Make a server for interaction with database
2. Create two files, app.py containing a server code and database.by containing functions with interactions with database
3. Realisation of 3 GET queries and 1 POST query
